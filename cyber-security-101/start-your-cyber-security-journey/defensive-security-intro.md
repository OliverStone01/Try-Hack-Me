## Notes

### Task 1 - Introduction to Defensive Security

Defensive security is concerned with two main tasks:
- Preventing intrusions from occuring
- Detecting intrustions when they occur and responding properly

Blue teams are part of the defensive security landscape.

Some of the tasks that are related to defensive security include:
- User cycle security awarenesstry: Training users about cyber security helps protect against attacks targetting their systems.
- Documenting and managing assets: We need to know the systems and devices we must manage and protext adequately.
- Updating and patching systems: Ensuring that computers, servers, and network devices are correctly updated and patched against any known vulnerability (weakness).
- Setting up preventative security devices: Firewall and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) are critical components of preventative security. Firewalls control what network traffic can go inside and what can leave the system or network. IPS blocks any network traffic that matches present rules and attack signatures.
- Setting up logging and monitoring devices: Proper network logging and monitoring are essential for detecting malicious activity and intrusions. If a new unauthorised device appears on our network, we should be able to detect it.

There is much more to defensive security:
- Security Operations Center (SOC)
- Threat intelligence
- Digital Forensics and incident response (DFIR)
- Malware Analysis

### Task 2 - Areas of Defensive Security

The Two main topics related to defensive security are:

- Security Operations Center (SOC)
- Digital Forensics and incident response (DFIR)

#### Security Operations Center (SOC)

A SOC is a team of cyber security professionals that monitor the network and its systems to detect malicious events. Some main areas of interest are:

- Vulnerabilities: If a system vulnerability is discovered, it must be fixed by installing a proper update or patch. When a fix is not available, steps should be taken to prevent am attacker from exploiting it.
- Policy violations: A security policy is a set of riles required to protect the network and systems. For example, a policy violation if users upload confidential company data to an online storage service.
- Unauthorised activity: Consider the case where a user's username and password are stolen, and the attacker uses them to log into the network. A SOC must detect and block such an event as soon as possible.
- Network intrusions: No matter how good your security is, there is always a chance for an intrusion. An intrusion can occur when a user clicks on a malicious link or when an attacker exploits a public server. When an intrusion occurs, we must detect it as soon as possible to prevent further damage.


#### Threat intelligence

In this context, intelligence refers to information you gather about actual and potential enemies. A threat is any action that can disrupt or adversely affect a system. Threat intelligence collects information to help the company better prepare against potential adversaries. The purpose would be to achive a threat-informed defence. Some adversaries might seek to steal customer data from a mobile operator; however, others are interested in halting the production.

intelligence needs data. Data has to be collected, processed, and analysed. Data is collected from local sources such as network logs and public sources such as forums. Data processing arranges it into a format suitable for analysis. The analysis phase seeks to find more information abot the attackers and their motives; moreover, it aims to create a list of recomendations and actionable steps.

Learning about your attackers lets you know their tactics, techniques, and procesures. As a result of intelligencem we indentify the threat actor and predict their activity.
