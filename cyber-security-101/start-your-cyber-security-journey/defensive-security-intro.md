### Task 1 - Introduction to Defensive Security

Defensive security is concerned with two main tasks:
- Preventing intrusions from occuring
- Detecting intrustions when they occur and responding properly

Blue teams are part of the defensive security landscape.

Some of the tasks that are related to defensive security include:
- User cycle security awarenesstry: Training users about cyber security helps protect against attacks targetting their systems.
- Documenting and managing assets: We need to know the systems and devices we must manage and protext adequately.
- Updating and patching systems: Ensuring that computers, servers, and network devices are correctly updated and patched against any known vulnerability (weakness).
- Setting up preventative security devices: Firewall and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) are critical components of preventative security. Firewalls control what network traffic can go inside and what can leave the system or network. IPS blocks any network traffic that matches present rules and attack signatures.
- Setting up logging and monitoring devices: Proper network logging and monitoring are essential for detecting malicious activity and intrusions. If a new unauthorised device appears on our network, we should be able to detect it.

There is much more to defensive security:
- Security Operations Center (SOC)
- Threat intelligence
- Digital Forensics and incident response (DFIR)
- Malware Analysis
