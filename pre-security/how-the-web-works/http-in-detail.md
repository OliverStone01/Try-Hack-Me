## Notes

### Task 1 - How websites work
When you visit a website, your browser makes a request to a web server asking for information about the page you are visiting. The server will respond with the data that your browser needs to display the page.
```
        -> Request from browser ->        -> Request from browser ->
[Browser]                        [Internet]                      [server]
        <- Response from server <-        <- Response from server <-
```

There are two major components that make up a webiste:
- Front end (Client-side) - the way your browser renders a website
- Back end (Server-side) - processes your request and returns a response.
