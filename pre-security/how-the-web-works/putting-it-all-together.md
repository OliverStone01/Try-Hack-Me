## Notes

### Task 1 - Putting it all together

To summarise, when you request a website, your computer needs to know the server's IP address it needs to talk to; for this, it uses DNS. Your computer then talks to the web server using a special set of commands called the HTTP protocol; the webserver then returns HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Images, etc., which your browser then uses to correctly format and display the website to you.

### Task 2 - Other Components

#### Load balencers

When a website's traffic starts getting quite large or is running an application that needs to have high availability, one web server may not be enough to handle the load. Load balancers provide two main features, ensuring high trafiic websites can handle the load and providing a failover if a server becomes unresponsive.

When you request a website with a load balancer, the load balancer will receive your request first and then forward it to one of the mulitple servers behind it. The load balancer uses diffrent algorithms to help it decide which server is best to deal with the request. A couple of examples of these algorithms are `round-robin`, which sends it to each server in turn, or `weighted`, which checks how many requests a server is currently dealing with and sends it to least busy server.

Load balancers also perform periodic checks with each server to ensure they are running correctly; this is called a `health check`. If a server doesn't respond appropriately or doesn't respond, the load balencer will stop sending traffic until it responds appropriately again.


#### CDN (Content Delivery Networks)

A CDN can be an excellent resource for cutting down traffic by allowing you to host static files from your website, such as JavaScript, CSS, Images, Videos, and host them across thousands of servers all over the world. When a user requests one of the hosted files, teh CDN works out where the nearest server is physically located and sends the request there instead of sending the data from the other side of the world.


#### Databases

Often websites will need a way of stroing information for their users. Webservers can communicate with databases to store and recall data from them. Databases can range from just a simple plain text file up to complex clusters of multiple servers providing speed and resilience. You'll come across some common databases: MySQL, MSSQL, MongoDB, PostGres, and more; each has its specific features.

#### WAF (Web Application Firewall)

A WAF sits between your web request and the web server; its purpose is to protect the webserver from hacking or denial of service attacks. It analyses the web requests for common attack techniques, whether the request is from a real browser rather than a bot. It also checks if an excessive amount of web requests are being sent by utilising something called rate limiting, which only allow a certain amount of requests from an IP per second. If a request is deemed a potential attack, it will be dropped and never sent to the webserver.
