## Notes

### Task 1 - Introduction

Welcome to the first part of the "Linux Fundamentals" room series. You're most likely using a Windows or Mac machine, both are different in visual design and how they operate. Just like Windows, IOS and MacOS, Linux is just another operating system and one of the most popular in the world powering smart cars, android devices, supercomputers, home appliances, enterprise servers, and more.

### Task 2 - A Bit of Background on Linux

#### Where is Linux used

It's fair to say that linux is a lot more intimidating to approach than Operating Systems (OS) such as Windows. Both variants have their own advantages and disadvantages. For example, Linux is considerably much more lightweight and you'd be suprised to know that there's a good chance you've used Linux in some form or another every day! Linux powers things like:
- Websites you visit
- Car entertainment/control panels
- Point of sale (PoS) systems such as checkout tills.
- Critical infrastructure such as traffic controllers.

#### Flavours of Linux

The name `Linux` is an umbrella term for multiple OS's that are based on UNIX (another operating systems). Thanks to Linux being open-source, varients of Linux come in all shapes and sizes - suited best for what the system is being used for.

For example, Ubuntu & Debian are some of the more commonplace distributions of Linux because it is so extensive. For example, you can use Ubuntu as a server (website & web application) or a desktop.

Ubuntu servers can run on systems with only 512mb of RAM.

### Task 3 - Interacting with your first Linux machine

This room has a Ubuntu Linux machine that you can interact with in your browser.

Press "Start Machine" to interact with your own Linux machine.

-----

### Task 4 - Running your first few commands

As we spoke about before, a large reason you may want to use Ubuntu or any Linux OS is because of how lightweight they can be. This does come with some disadvantages. For example, most of the OS's dont have a GUI (graphical user interface), this is also known as a desktop enviroment that the user can use to interact with the machine vistually. Instead, the user needs to use whats called a `Terminal`.

The `Terminal` is a text-based way of controling the device. Let's look at some of the commands used with the `Terminal` and lets look at the command line:
```
// Command line
tryhackme@linux1:~$ enter commands here
```

Lets now look at some basic functions like navigating to files, outputting their contents and make files:
```
Command    |  Description
- - - - - -|- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
echo       | Output any text provided
- - - - - -|- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
whoami     | Find out what user we're currently logged in as.
- - - - - -|- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
```

Here is some examples of the echo commands:
```
tryhackme@linux1:~$ echo Hello
Hello

tryhackme@linux1:~$ echo "Hello Friend!"
Hello Friend!
```

As you can see above, if you want to `echo` one word then you don't need the double quotes like you do when you use multiple words.

`whoami` can be used to find the current username we are logged in as:
```
tryhackme@linux1:~$ whoami
```

-----

### Task 5 - Interacting with the filesystem

#### Interacting with the filesystem

Being able to navigate the machine that you are logged into without needing a desktop enviroment is important.
```
Command  |  Full name
- - - - -|- - - - - - - - - - - - - -
ls       |  Listing
- - - - -|- - - - - - - - - - - - - -
cd       |  Change directory
- - - - -|- - - - - - - - - - - - - -
cat      |  Concatenate
- - - - -|- - - - - - - - - - - - - -
pwd      |  Print Working Directory
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
```

#### Listing files in our current directory(s)

Before we can do anything such as finding out the contents of any files or folders, we need to know what exists in the first place. This can be done using the `ls` command:
```
tryhackme@linux1:~$ ls
'Important Files' 'My Documents' Notes Pictures
```

The above shows the following directories and folders:
- Important Files
- My Documents
- Notes
- Pictures

Instead of needing to go into the next directory to see whats in it, you can do `ls Pictures` for example.


#### Changing out current directory (cd)

Now we know what exists inside of a directory, we can enter that directory by using the `cd` command. Say we wanted to open the Pictures directory, we would do `cd Pictures`:
```
tryhackme@linux1:~$ cd Pictures
tryhackme@linux1:~/Pictures$
```

As you can see by the `/Pictures`, we are now inside the pictures directory.


#### Outputting the contents of a file (cat)

To view the contents of a file, we can use the `cat` command:
```
tryhackme@linux1:~/Documents$ ls
todo.txt
tryhackme@linux1:~/Documents$ cat todo.txt
Here's something important for me to do later!
```

You can also use cat from outside of the directory, for example:
```
tryhackme@linux1:~$ cat /Documents/todo.txt
Here's something important for me to do later!
```

#### Finding out the full path to our current working directory (pwd)
