## Notes:

Task 1:

Defensive security (Blue Team) is concerned with two main tasks:
1. Preventing intrusions from occurring.
2. Detecting intrusions when they occur and responding properly.

Some of the tasks related to defensive security include:
- User cyber security awareness: training users to help protect against attacks.
- Documenting and managing assets: We need to know the systems and devices to be able to manage and protect them
- Updating and patching systems: Ensuring that computers, servers, and network devices are correctly updated and patched to prevent agaist known * vulnerabilities.
- Setting up preventative security devices: firewalls & IPS (Intrusion prevention systems)
- setting up logging and monitoring devices: If a new unauthorised device appears of the network, you want to be able to see it.

We will also look at:
- Security Operations Center (SOC)
- Threat Intelligence
- Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)
- Malware Analysys

Task 2:

Security Operations Center (SOC):
    A team of cyber security professionals that monitors the network and it's systems to detect malicious cyber security events.

    Main Intrests are:
    - Vulnerabilities: Fixing vulnerabilities by installing updates or patches.
    - Policy violations: A set of rules required to protect the network and systems.
    - Unauthorised activity: When a password and username are stollen by an attacker, this must be fixed as soon as possible.
    - Network intrusions: Can occur when a user clicks on on a malicious link or an attcker exploits a public server.

    Threat Intelligence

    In this context, 
- Digital Forensics and incident response (DFIR)
